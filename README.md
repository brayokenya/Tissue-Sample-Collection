# Tissue Sample Collection Web Application

## Overview

This web application provides an administrative interface for managing a Tissue Sample directory. Users can view collections, drill into collection details, add new samples to existing collections, and create new collections.

## Requirements

The minimum viable product includes the following features:

- Display a list of collections on the home page (including their title and associated disease).
- Drill into a collectionâ€™s record to view the details of their currently associated samples.
- Add a new sample to an existing collection.
- Create a new collection.

| 1  | Cirrhosis of liver | Mothers Pregnancy Samples     |
| 2  | Malignant tumour of breast | Phase II multicentre study  |
| 3  | Fit and well | Lymphoblastoid cell lines           |
| 4  | Chronic fatigue syndrome | Samples available include ME/CFS Cases |
| 5  | Malignant tumour of breast | A randomised placebo-controlled trial |

### Samples

| Id | Collection_Id | Donor_Count | Material_Type         | Last_Updated |

## How to Execute the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/brayokenya/Tissue-Sample-Collection.git


    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd Tissue-Sample-Collection/

    # Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    make venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install project dependencies
    make install

    # Run the development server
    make run

    #Running Tests

    cd SampleApp/

    pytest -s tests.py

## Future Plans


1. Ensure Collections and samples can only be deleted by their sole creators(Users that created the collections)

2. Dockerize the Application for easier Deployment

3. Use it as a learning tool to improve and maintain the current existing system at
